# Adecco LinkedIn Performance Dashboard Analysis

This project presents a data analysis and visualization of Adecco Group’s LinkedIn performance using a performance dashboard created in Python. The analysis covers engagement trends, follower growth, content impact, and post-type effectiveness, helping stakeholders gain actionable insights from social media metrics.

## Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to understand how Adecco’s LinkedIn content performs over time by visualizing:
- Follower growth trends (monthly and quarterly)
- User engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments)
- Effectiveness of new vs. reused content
- Post-type performance (feed, story, thread)
- Correlation between engagement (comments) and follower gains

The dashboard simplifies complex data and helps marketers and content strategists make data-driven decisions.
